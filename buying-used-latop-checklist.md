# Checklist - Buying used laptop
- ## This model is good for you?
Check specification, and reviews about the laptop. Maybe you can check there is any bigger issue with that model. I used to google the laptop's name (brand & model) and `issue` keyword together.

- ## Check condition
Look for any damage, the whole outlook of the laptop.

- ## Test hardware
	- CPU, GPU, [RAM](https://www.memtest86.com/), and [storage](https://www.hdsentinel.com/)

	- Check that every port is working (HDMI, USB, etc.)
	- Speakers (& microphone & webcam)
	- Battery
	` powercfg /batteryreport `

- ## Functions that you need
If you have special needs, e.g. thunderbolt connection, or keyboard lightning check it.
You can also check the memory, SATA, and M.2 slots in the laptop, if you are planning to upgrade it.

- ## Display & keyboard
	- [Display test](https://www.eizo.be/monitor-test/)
	- [Keyboard test](https://en.key-test.ru/)
	- [Typing test](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) - Check if it's comfortable for you

- ## Warranty
Not always a must-have, but good to know.

If the laptop has no warranty from the manufacturer, sometimes the seller undertake a "try-warranty" e.g. one-week or similar.

- ## Ask the seller
You can ask about the usage of the laptop, where was it bought, the issues of the laptop, or anything you should know about.
